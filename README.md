# Reed Tech Support

This was a website that I wrote for my stint as the neighboorhood tech support guy.
Users could request visits on the website, specifying their ideal dates/times and their problem
and then the website would both text me the details and add them to a database.

It was deployed on Heroku.
The website has since been shut down.
